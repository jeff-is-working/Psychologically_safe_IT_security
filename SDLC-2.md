# PeopleSafe SDLC Journaling Technique

## Origin

The PeopleSafe SDLC technique is a focused adaptation of **The G.L.A.D. Technique**, developed by Donald Altman as a particularly useful approach for developing a grateful attitude toward life (see *The Mindfulness Toolbox*, New Harbinger Publications).

The original G.L.A.D. framework uses:
- **G**ratitude
- **L**earning
- **A**ccomplishment
- **D**elight

## The SDLC Framework

SDLC recasts these reflections for the IT and cybersecurity community:

- **S — Success**: Where did I have success today? Recognizing wins, however small — a clean deployment, a resolved ticket, a productive conversation.
- **D — Delight**: What brought me delight today? Noticing moments of genuine enjoyment — an elegant solution, a team joke, a perfect cup of coffee during a long session.
- **L — Learning**: What did I learn today? Honoring the continuous growth that defines our field — a new tool, a different perspective, an unexpected lesson from a failure.
- **C — Compliment**: What can I compliment about my day? Acknowledging the positive in yourself and others — patience during a difficult incident, a colleague's helpful code review, your own persistence.

## Why SDLC?

SDLC is one of the most recognized acronyms in IT — the **Software Development Life Cycle** (or **Security Development Life Cycle**). By deliberately repurposing it, we create a dual reinforcement:

1. The practice of daily directed positive journaling
2. The foundational importance of structured life-cycle thinking in our professional work

This mnemonic bridge helps IT professionals remember the practice and grounds it in our professional identity.

## Personal Growth Applications

Both the original G.L.A.D. and the adapted SDLC techniques are grounded in positive psychology research showing that directed attention to positive experiences physically rewires neural pathways. Benefits include:

- **Increased awareness** of positive events that might otherwise go unnoticed
- **Stronger gratitude** orientation, which correlates with improved well-being
- **Better emotional regulation** through daily reflective practice
- **Compound perspective shifts** — small daily entries create significant changes over months and years

## Professional Growth Applications

For IT and cybersecurity professionals specifically, SDLC journaling addresses:

### Burnout Resilience
The constant vigilance required in security work, combined with incident fatigue and imposter syndrome, creates fertile ground for burnout. Documenting daily successes and delights builds a concrete counter-narrative to the negativity bias inherent in security-focused thinking.

### Career Development
Your SDLC journal becomes a personal record of growth, achievements, and learning moments. During performance reviews, job searches, or certification pursuits, this record provides specific examples that are otherwise forgotten.

### Recognizing Technical Wins
In IT, success is often invisible — systems that *don't* go down, vulnerabilities that *don't* get exploited, deployments that proceed *without* incident. SDLC journaling creates space to recognize and document these invisible victories.

### Team and Culture Impact
The "Compliment" category specifically encourages recognizing others' contributions. Over time, this practice can shift how you engage with colleagues and contribute to a more psychologically safe team environment.

## The Practice

### When to Journal
- **Daily**, ideally at the end of your workday or before bed
- Each entry can be as brief as a single sentence per category
- The barrier to entry should be as low as possible — *something* is always better than nothing

### Consistency Over Length
A four-word entry written every day for a year is more valuable than a detailed essay written once. The practice builds through repetition. Aim for a "minimum viable entry" on hard days and let yourself expand on good ones.

### Compound Perspective Shifts
The real power of SDLC journaling reveals itself over weeks and months. Individual entries are building blocks; the structure they build is a fundamentally different relationship with your daily experience.

## Rollup Reflections

Periodic review is where patterns become visible:

- **Weekly rollups** surface immediate themes and momentum
- **Monthly rollups** reveal habits, recurring challenges, and growth trajectories
- **Quarterly rollups** show seasonal patterns and major professional arcs
- **Yearly rollups** provide a comprehensive view of your evolution

During rollup reviews, ask yourself:
- What categories consistently have the most content? The least?
- What themes recur in your learning entries?
- Are your successes clustering around certain skills or projects?
- Where does delight appear unexpectedly?

## Privacy as a Foundation

Psychological safety and data security share a fundamental principle: **genuine safety requires genuine protection**, not just the appearance of it.

This journal is encrypted with AES-256-GCM using a key derived from your passphrase through PBKDF2 with 600,000 iterations. Your entries never leave your browser. There is no server, no analytics, no telemetry, no tracking. The encryption is not a feature — it is a prerequisite. Honest self-reflection requires confidence that your thoughts are truly private.

Your journal belongs to you alone.
