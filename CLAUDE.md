# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a content repository (no code) collecting cybersecurity mental health resources and support information for IT/cybersecurity professionals. The primary contribution is the **PeopleSafe SDLC Technique** — a daily journaling methodology adapted from Donald Altman's G.L.A.D. Technique, reframed using the SDLC acronym familiar to software/security professionals.

### SDLC Technique Pillars
- **S**uccess — Where did I have success today?
- **D**elight — What brought me delight today?
- **L**earning — What did I learn today?
- **C**ompliment — What can I compliment about my day?

## Repository Structure

- `README.md` — Project description
- `SDLC-2` — The SDLC daily journaling technique description (plain text, no extension)

## Status

This project is in early development. Planned but not yet created: worksheet templates and guidance for daily practice. There is no build system, tests, or code — all content is prose.

## Notes

The repository name contains a known typo ("Pyschologically" instead of "Psychologically") which is consistent in both the directory name and the GitHub remote URL.
